## Pull Request Process
1. Ensure that any new dependency is added to mix.exs, and the compilation works from a clean pull from the branch
2. Update the README.md if necessary, and the [Design Decisions](#design-decisions) section
3. Ensure you have tests covering the core parts of the pull request
4. Open the PR and ask for review from any maintainer. The sign-off from one maintainer is already enough to merge the PR.
